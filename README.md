My first challenge from Frontend Mentor https://www.frontend mentor.io. The challenge was to make a product preview card component. It went very well I think. Feel free to try my work. I welcome constructive criticism. So don't hesitate if you have any improvement suggestions regarding this project.
Had some trouble to use html srcset. I solved this by using the images as background images, not by using the img tags with srcset.
Thanks!
